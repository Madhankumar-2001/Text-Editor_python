## Aim

Develop a basic text editor using Python that allows users to create, edit, and save text files.

## Description

This project involves creating a simple text editor with essential features such as creating new files, opening existing files, editing text, and saving changes. The text editor can be enhanced by adding additional functionalities like syntax highlighting or word count. This project will provide hands-on experience with file I/O operations in Python and GUI development.

### Features

- **Create New Files**: Allows users to create new text files from scratch.
- **Open Existing Files**: Enables users to open and edit existing text files.
- **Edit Text**: Provides basic text editing functionalities.
- **Save Changes**: Saves the edited text back to a file.
- **Syntax Highlighting (Optional)**: Enhances the editor with syntax highlighting for code.
- **Word Count (Optional)**: Displays the word count of the text being edited.

### Technologies

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the text editor.
- **Tkinter (Optional)**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the text editor.

### What You Learn

- **File I/O Operations**: Learn how to perform input/output operations on text files using Python.
